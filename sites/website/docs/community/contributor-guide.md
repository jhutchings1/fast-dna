# Contributor Guide

Our contributors use these standards for consistency and quality in the repository.

## Standards
### Naming conventions

* Avoid abbreviations unless they are common industry acronyms.
* Use names that are clear and intuitive.
* Use semantic names instead of presentational.

### Accessibility

Accessibility is acknowledged from the start of each new feature and must be addressed in a specification in the created issue before work can begin.
