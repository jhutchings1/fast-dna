# Testing

## Checklist

This testing checklist is a good starting point for manual testing web applications.

1. Test each page for design and content issues
    1. Test screen sizes from viewport 1 to 6
    2. Test screen orientations
        1. Portrait
        2. Landscape
    3. Test word length and case
        1. Test the smallest amount of text
        2. Test the largest amount of text
        3. Case sensitivity
2. Test for localization (RTL, LTR)
3. Test for progressive enhancement
    1. Test complete browser matrix
    2. Test for zooming browser from 200% and 25%
4. Test each component and pages for accessibility issues
    1. Test for keyboard accessibility
    2. Test for Mouse only interaction
    3. Test for Touch interaction
    4. Test with High Contrast of OS
    5. Test without images
    6. Test for text only
    7. Test with a screen reader

## Manual testing

FAST UI development tools offer a solution for manually testing components during development. Easily test with features such as viewport, localized direction (RTL or LTR), background transparency, color themes, and interactive properties.

Additionally, we offer testing services under `./build/testing` that can be used to assist in comprehensive testing. We have included these configurations and tests as a starting point. Run the tests manually, and the cloud services dashboard can be used to evaluate your code changes before submitting for code review.

### Testing on physical devices

When testing local code on physical devices, Localtunnel allows you to easily share a web service on your local machine without managing DNS and firewall settings.

Localtunnel assigns a unique publicly accessible URL that proxies all requests to your local web server.

#### Quickstart

Install Localtunnel globally (requires NodeJS):

```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
```

* Start a web server on a local port (eg, [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)) and use the command line interface to request a tunnel to the local server:

```bash
lt --port 8000
```

* You receive a URL to share as long as your local instance remains active. Requests route to your local service at the specified port.

## Cross browser testing
